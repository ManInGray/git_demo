On a long and lonesome highway, east of Omaha
You can listen to the engines moanin' out his one old song
Think about the woman or the girl you knew the night before
But your thoughts will soon be wanderin', the way they always do

When you're ridin' sixteen hours and there's nothin' much to do
And you don't feel much like ridin', you wish the trip was through
